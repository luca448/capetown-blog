        <h2 id="where">Where Do We Live?</h2>
        <p>We moved to Paarl, near Cape Town, in a safe gated community. It's never boring here with swimming pools, shops, and medical services.</p>

        <h2>The House</h2>
        <p>We live in a big villa in <a href="https://www.valdevie.co.za/">Val de Vie Estate</a>. It has bedrooms, a large living room, an outdoor swimming pool, and a South African braai.</p>
        
        <h2 id="school">My School</h2>
        <p>I have to drive to school every morning and wear a uniform made of cotton, which is comfortable in the heat.</p>

        <h3>School Activities</h3>
        <p>We went on a hiking trip to the ocean and learned about the history and culture of South Africa.</p>

        <h2 id="activities">Things We Did</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Table Mountain:</strong> We took the cable car to the top and enjoyed the view.</li>

            <li><strong>Kaap de Goede Hoop:</strong> It was very windy but beautiful.</li>

            <li><strong>Almost Saw the Big Five:</strong> We saw lions, giraffes, elephants, and rhinos, but not the cheetah.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2 id="food">Where We Ate</h2>
        <h3>The Best Burger</h3>
        <p>At <a href="https://www.yardco.co.za/">The Dogs Bollocks</a>, I had the best burger I've ever eaten!</p>
        <img src="images/image5.jpg" alt="Eating the Best Burger">
        
        <h3>Karibu Restaurant</h3>
        <p>Located near the water in Cape Town, I enjoyed a braai while my parents had soup and salad.</p>

        <h2 id="events">Events and Festivals</h2>
        <h3>Rugby</h3>
        <p>Rugby is the most important sport in South Africa, and the Springboks are the national team.</p>
        
        <h3>Freedom Day</h3>
        <p>On April 27th, South Africa celebrates the first democratic elections.</p>
        
        <h3>Nelson Mandela Day</h3>
        <p>On July 18th, we honor Nelson Mandela, who ended apartheid in South Africa.</p>
